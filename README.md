# Optimized-Equipment-Utilization-and-Management-for-IVF-Laboratory-Operations

## Overview 📌

This project aims to improve the usage and management of equipment in IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) laboratories. IVF labs use costly and critical equipment such as incubators, microscopes and ICIS (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) workstations for important medical procedures. Due to poor planning and uneven usage, some equipment remains idle while others are overused, causing delays and increased operational costs.

The project proposes a centralized, data driven system to monitor equipment used and availability. This system helps in better scheduling, reducing downtime and improving overall workflow efficiency.

The objective of the project is to maximize equipment utilization, reduce delays and lower unnecessary operational costs, there by improving the performance of IVF laboratory operations.  


## Dataset 📁

- Source : Dataset provided by 360DigiTMG as part of the Data Analytics training program.
- Format : CSV
- Description : The dataset contains structured healthcare-related data used to analyze equipment usage, operational efficiency and key performance indicators within an IVF laboratory environment. It helps identify utilization patterns, downtime and areas for process improvement.


## Tools & Technologies 🛠

- Python : Data cleaning, preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- SQL(MySQL) : Querying and analyzing equipment usage and operational records.
- Power BI : Creating interactive dashboards to monitor equipment utilization and performance.
- Power point : Preparing project presentations and insights for reporting.
- Spyder : Python development environment for data analysis and visualization.
